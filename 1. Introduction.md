## Introduction to Andronix Packages
Andronix uses Termux at it's core and all the essential packages building utilities are taken from the open-source repositories of termux (which can be found here). We are extremely thankful for the contribution that the people in the Termux team have been doing to utilize the free-spirit of the Android ecosystem.

Coming to the packages that are required for termux to function properly inside Andronix, a few changes are needed before compiling anything for the app. We will be using the official Docker image provided by Termux in the initial stages of the Termux and Andronix's integration since they are updated frequently and are more reliable.
